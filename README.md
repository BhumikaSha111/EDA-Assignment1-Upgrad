Problem Statement
The assignment aims to use Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify the factors that influence loan defaults in a consumer finance company. By analyzing historical loan data, the goal is to recognize patterns that can predict whether a loan applicant is likely to default, helping the company to minimize financial risks while optimizing business growth.

Analysis Approach
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Begin by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features to prepare the data for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Univariate Analysis: Examine the distribution of individual variables to understand the general characteristics of loan applicants.
Bivariate Analysis: Explore relationships between different variables, particularly focusing on how they relate to the target variable (loan default).
Outlier Detection and Removal: Identify and address any anomalies in the data that could distort the analysis.
Feature Selection: Determine the most significant variables that are strong indicators of default through EDA and statistical methods.

Insights and Recommendations: Use the findings from EDA and modeling to provide actionable insights, such as identifying high-risk applicants or adjusting loan offerings to mitigate potential losses.
